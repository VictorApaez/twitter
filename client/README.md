# Twitter Clone Front-End

## Overview

This project is a front-end clone of Twitter, currently in progress, built with Next.js and React. It aims to replicate the core features of Twitter, allowing users to view a news feed, and create and edit posts, comments, and replies. Authentication is managed using Auth0, and Apollo GraphQL is used for backend communication. As this is a work in progress, additional features and improvements are being actively developed.
